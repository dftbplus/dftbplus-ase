DFTB+ ASE Calculator
********************

Provides a calculator for `DFTB+ <https://dftbplus.org>`_ to be used within the
`Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) <https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/>`_
framework. It was originally derived from the `DFTB` calculator in ASE, but had
been completely rewritten. The calculators API is not compatible with the API of
the original calculator.

This project is maintained by the DFTB+ developers and is not part of the
official ASE project.
